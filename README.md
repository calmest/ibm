# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### comment as to what i am to do

Create a form (with proper HTML semantics) that includes the following:
-A fieldset to hold your todo items - Todo Form
-Text input to add a new item
-Button to add new item
When a new item is added, the following should happen:
-Add an item to the fieldset with the following:
—Name of the item
—Checkbox to mark as done
-Save item to localstorage
-Input field cleared
-Focus set to the input field
When an item's checkbox is checked:
-Remove the item from the document
-Remove the item if it's saved locally
-Reset the keyboard focus
—If it's the last item, set keyboard focus to the input box
—If there is an item after the removed item, set keyboard focus to that item's checkbox
—If there is no item after the removed item, set the keyboard focus to the previous item's checkbox
When the page is loaded:
-Populate list of items from those saved locally
